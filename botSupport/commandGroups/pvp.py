You decide how the attack is preformed taking into account the stats of the attacker. for example a low strength attacker that wants to throw a rock might throw a smaller one then a high strength. All Stats are on a scale of 1 - 10
You need to decide what type of attack this is. There are two types, `Single Target`, or `AOE`. If you believe the attack would have an large enough of an area effect then it is an AOE attack. This shouldn't be easy but require a sufficiently broad attack.
